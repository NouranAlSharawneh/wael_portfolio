            <p>
              I am Wael ALsharawneh, a qualified architect and interior designer
              with a bachelor&apos;s degree from the University of Kent in the
              United Kingdom. I have extensive experience in delivering
              innovative, client-centric designs for commercial and residential
              spaces in Saudi Arabia. I have worked as an architect in design
              for several reputable firms, where I honed my skills and knowledge
              in various aspects of the architectural and design process. I
              specialize in creating exceptional exterior and interior projects
              that reflect the functionality, aesthetics, and brand identity of
              each client. I collaborate closely with clients to understand
              their needs and preferences, and ensure complete satisfaction with
              the quality and outcome of my work. I take pride in my reputation
              for excellence and customer care in the architectural and design
              industry.
